# SB Stream Chemistry Assembly
# October 24, 2021
# Heili Lowman

# The following script will assemble the stream chemistry datasets available for the SBC LTER stream sites into a single data file for use in the MARSS analysis for the CRASS project.

# Load packages
library(plyr) # needs to be loaded prior to dplyr
library(tidyverse) # contains dplyr
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(naniar)

# Load dataset
chem_reg <- read_csv("data_raw/sbclter_stream_chemistry_allyears_registered_stations_20190628.csv")
# After reviewing the metadata on the SBC LTER website, chose not to include non-registered sites,
# because there is no geolocation data available/published for them, like there is for the registered
# sites.
#chem_nreg <- read_csv("data_raw/sbclter_stream_chemistry_allyears_non_registered_stations_20190628.csv")

# Combine datasets
# chem_full <- rbind(chem_reg, chem_nreg)

# Note: -999 is the "NA" record used by the LTER
# Make edits for data assembly purposes
chem_full_ed <- chem_reg %>% # can't remove records because in wide format
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x == -999.0) %>% # so instead replace with NA
  mutate(DateTime = ymd_hms(timestamp_local)) %>% # format dates
  mutate(Year = year(DateTime), Month = month(DateTime))

# Calculate mean monthly concentrations at all sites.
# Note: For this first iteration, not weighted by discharge.
chem_full_monthly <- chem_full_ed %>%
  group_by(site_code, Year, Month) %>%
  summarize(mean_nh4_uM = mean(nh4_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_no3_uM = mean(no3_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_po4_uM = mean(po4_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_tdn_uM = mean(tdn_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_tdp_uM = mean(tdp_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_tpc_uM = mean(tpc_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_tpn_uM = mean(tpn_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_tpp_uM = mean(tpp_uM, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_tss_mgL = mean(tss_mgperLiter, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_cond_uScm = mean(spec_cond_uSpercm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(site = factor(site_code))

# And export for MARSS script
saveRDS(chem_full_monthly, "data_working/SBchem_edited_102421.rds")

# End of script.
