# Valles Caldera National Preserve (vcnp) Fire Data Assembly
# November 3, 2021
# Betsy Summers following Heili Lowman's workflow

# The following script will assemble the fire datasets available for the VCNP  stream sites into a single data file for use in the MARSS analysis for the CRASS project.

# the main fires of interest that overlap with the grab water quality data set are (date = month of ignition):
# 1) Las Conchas fire (Start date: 26 June, 2011)
# 2) Thompson Ridge fire (start date: 31 May, 2013)

## Load packages
library(plyr) # needs to be loaded prior to dplyr
library(tidyverse) # contains dplyr
library(lubridate)
library(here)

# NOTE: THIS WAS ALL RE-DONE BY HEILI ON 2/24/22 HAVING FOUND A PREVIOUS ERROR
# WITH HOW THE FIRE DUMMY VARIABLES POPULATED.
# And edited on 7/29/2022 by Alex to add fire areas and burn percent of watersheds, set fire effect to one column with an effect lasting 2 months, and remove decay effects. 

# Create base dataframe of dates and sites (from June 2005 to March 2019). This timeframe
# was chosen based on available precipitation data.
# Create sequence of dates
d <- seq(as.Date("2005/6/1"), by = "month", length.out = 166)

# Repeat 7 times for each site
d7 <- rep(d, times = 7)
d7df <- data.frame(d7)

# Create repeated sequence of sites
s <- rep(c("EFJ", "RSAW", "RSA", "IND", "IND_BB", "RED", "SULF"), each=166)
sdf <- data.frame(s)

# Bind dates and sites together
dates <- cbind(d7df, sdf)
colnames(dates) <- c("date","site")

# load fire area data
fire_area = read.csv("data_raw/sbc_vc_ws_fire_areas.csv")

## Fire names and start dates of burn - sites affected
# Las Conchas (2011-06-26) - EFJ, RSAW, RSA, IND, IND_BB
# Thompson Ridge (2013-05-31) - RED, EFJ, RSAW, SULF
# Prescribed burn (2016-05-11) - EFJ [Out of time frame]

## Add in columns for the fires based on start dates:
# 1 - denotes month of ignition + one additional month

# currently use Date variable to determine when site is 1 or 0.
# As of 12/6/2021 - we are adding in dummy variable (1s) only for the year
# As of 07/28/2022 - we are adding in dummy variables (1s) only for the month of ignition and no decay term
# Conchas = Las Conchas fire
# Thompson = Thompson Ridge fire

# commented out those fires/sites that resulted in a column of all zeros
# which the MARSS model doesn't like
