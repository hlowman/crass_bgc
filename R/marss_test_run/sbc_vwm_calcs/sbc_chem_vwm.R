# SB Stream Chemistry Calculations
# January 3, 2023
# Heili Lowman

# The following script will assemble the stream discharge datasets,
# as well as the volume weighted means by storm created by R. Aguilera,
# and calculate the remaining volume (discharge) weighted means to be
# used in the CRASS MARSS models for the Santa Barbara sites.

#### Setup ####

# Load packages
library(plyr) # needs to be loaded prior to dplyr
library(tidyverse) # contains dplyr
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(naniar)

library(dataRetrieval)

# Load discharge datasets.
# Note - not processing AT07 data since we do not have discharge data
# for the full record during which we have chemistry data.
# Also, John suggested removing this site from our analysis.
