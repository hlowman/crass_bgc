# Valles Caldera National Preservese (vcnp) Stream Chemistry Assembly
# November 8, 2021
# Betsy Summers following Heili Lowman's workflow 

# The following script will assemble the stream chemistry datasets available for the vcnp stream sites into a single data file for use in the MARSS analysis for the CRASS project.
# Note that time stamp of solute collection is roughly monthly so we don't need to take monthly means of solutes like done with the SBC solute dataset. 

# Load packages
library(plyr) # needs to be loaded prior to dplyr
library(tidyverse) # contains dplyr
library(lubridate)
library(here)
