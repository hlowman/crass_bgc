## Data


### Plot C-Q pre/post burn ###
# cumulative fire vs. recent mean chem

## Then apply filters: catchment size, Now add LULC filter & replot C-Q

######
# C-Q pre-post burn for burned catchments (how long post-burn window?): same year, 1 y, 2, y, 3 y, etc.
# time series for burned catchments
